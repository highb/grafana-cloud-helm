# og-grafana-agent

## Source

This chart is based on the [docs provided by Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/quickstart/agent_k8s/#installing-grafana-agent-on-kubernetes) which provide a set of k8s resources to be applied directly to the cluster. In order to increase the repeatability of that action, I have collected those configs into a helm chart.
